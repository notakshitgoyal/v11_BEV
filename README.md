# Real-time Traffic Monitoring System with Bird's Eye View Transformation

## Overview
This project implements a real-time traffic monitoring system using YOLOv11 object detection with Bird's Eye View (BEV) transformation. The system can detect vehicles, track their movement, calculate speeds, and generate heat maps for traffic density analysis.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- CPU: Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or better
- RAM: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- Storage: 2GB free space

### Software
```bash
Python 3.8+
CUDA 11.0+ (for GPU support)
OpenCV 4.5+
PyTorch 1.9+
```

### Dependencies
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-monitoring-bev.git
cd traffic-monitoring-bev
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the YOLOv11 weights:
```bash
wget https://path-to-weights/yolo11s.pt -O weights/yolo11s.pt
```

4. Prepare your assets:
```bash
mkdir assets
# Add your vehicle overlay images to assets/
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python yolo_v11_project.py
```

### Configuration
Modify key parameters in the script:
```python
MODEL_PATH = "yolo11s.pt"    # Path to YOLO model
VIDEO_PATH = "save.mp4"      # Input video path
NUM_FRAMES = 100             # Number of frames to process
DEVICE = 'mps'              # 'cpu', 'cuda', or 'mps'
CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.25       # Confidence threshold
```

### Benchmarking
Run performance benchmarks:
```bash
python benchmark_yolo.py
```
